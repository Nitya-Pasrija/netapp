Whether you're a new freelancer just starting out or a seasoned pro, Freelanzo can help you find work, get paid, and build your business.




## Future Integration- Dynamic Rating Model using Random Forest
This repository contains a dynamic rating model implemented using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is designed to accurately predict ratings based on various input features, achieving an impressive accuracy of approximately 91 percent.

ALGORITHM 
Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions. It overcomes some of the limitations of individual decision trees by reducing overfitting and increasing generalization. By aggregating predictions from multiple trees, Random Forest improves accuracy and robustness.

Model Evaluation
Our dynamic rating model achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 91 percent on the test dataset. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in accurately predicting ratings based on the given input features. The model's robustness and ability to handle various types of data make it suitable for a wide range of applications.
Future Improvements
While our dynamic rating model already achieves high accuracy, there are several potential areas for improvement:
Feature Engineering: Experiment with different feature combinations or create new features to enhance the model's predictive power.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the Random Forest model by exploring different hyperparameters to potentially improve its performance further.
Ensemble Methods: Investigate ensemble methods like stacking or boosting to leverage the strengths of multiple models and enhance the rating prediction accuracy.
